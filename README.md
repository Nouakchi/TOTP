# TOTP
(OTP) algorithm, namely the (HOTP) algorithm, as defined in RFC4226, to support the time-based moving factor. The HOTP algorithm specifies an event-based OTP algorithm, where the moving factor is an event counter. The present work bases the moving factor on a time value. short-lived OTP values, which are desirable for enhanced security.
